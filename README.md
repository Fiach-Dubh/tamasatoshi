Making Bitcoin Node Operation for Kids and Adults Fun!

The Challenge:

The Bitcoin node count has not gone up with adoption as much as hoped. Over the past 2 years the node count is up 21%, but this growth could and argueably should be much 
more considering the expansion of the Bitcoin market is now in multiples over the same period of time. Same goes for hashrate. Hashrate has doubled in the same time period, yet node count is lagging behind.

What then can be done to improve node count? we can try and advocate for peoples personnel self interest and self soverignty, sure.

Making Bitcoin Node Operation for Kids and Adults Fun!


Stage of Project: Ideaization


The Challenge:

The Bitcoin node count has not gone up with adoption as much as hoped. Over the past 2 years the node count is up 21%, but this growth could and argueably should be much 
more considering the expansion of the Bitcoin market is now in multiples over the same period of time. Same goes for hashrate. Hashrate has doubled in the same time period, yet node count is lagging behind.

What then can be done to improve node count? we can try and advocate for peoples personnel self interest and self soverignty, sure. And we should, but the vast majority of people in Bitcoin are hear for the price appreciation thesis, not network effects, self soverignty, or responsibility.
These values are extremely important, but lack stickiness to the current generation of wall street bet & shitcoin gamblers. In a word, they're hear for the wrong reasons, but may stay for the right ones eventually. 

They're here for bitcoin, not Bitcoin.

Thus, we propose to not focus on this current generation, but the next. The youth will be our vanguard in this fight for indvidual autonomy. 

How does one make running a Bitcoin node an emotional experiance instead of just a mechanical one with logical benefits?

Enter TamasaToshi. 


The Solution:

TamasaToshi is a simple idea. Sync your Bitcoin node with a animal like digital entity that survives and thrives on the health of your Bitcoin node. The goal is to make running a Bitcoin full node fun for kids, and maybe even adults too!

By representing a Bitcoin node as a small animal hungry for bitcoin blocks we hope to create an emotional attachment early in life that extends into adulthood. This will also help generate learning oppurtunities for why it is important to run a Bitcoin node if one wants to be self-soverign in this ecosystem. Completeing small tasks associated with the proper function of a Bitcoin node can generate points to be used for the growth and upgrading of your TamasaToshi.

Making Bitcoin Node Operation for Kids and Adults Fun!

The Challenge:

The Bitcoin node count has not gone up with adoption as much as hoped. Over the past 2 years the node count is up 21%, but this growth could and argueably should be much 
more considering the expansion of the Bitcoin market is now in multiples over the same period of time. Same goes for hashrate. Hashrate has doubled in the same time period, yet node count is lagging behind.

What then can be done to improve node count? we can try and advocate for peoples personnel self interest and self soverignty, sure. And we should, but the vast majority of people in Bitcoin are hear for the price appreciation thesis, not network effects, self soverignty, or responsibility.
These values are extremely important, but lack stickiness to the current generation of wall street bet & shitcoin gamblers. In a word, they're hear for the wrong reasons, but may stay for the right ones eventually. 

They're here for bitcoin, not Bitcoin.

Thus, we propose to not focus on this current generation, but the next. The youth will be our vanguard in this fight for indvidual autonomy. 

How does one make running a Bitcoin node an emotional experiance instead of just a mechanical one with logical benefits?

Enter TamasaToshi. 


The Solution:

TamasaToshi is a simple idea. Sync your Bitcoin node with a animal like digital entity that survives and thrives on the health of your Bitcoin node.
